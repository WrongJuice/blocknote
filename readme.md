My first project Solidity. It's a dapp that aims to store notes in a decentralized way.

I plan to evolve things in this order:

1 - The notes are public, not editable and are stored in the blockchain
2 - The notes become editable
3 - Notes are stored with IPFS
4 - Add private notes

The application will be developed in Solidity and I take advantage of this project to test different frameworks (truffle/hardhat), and maybe test the ide remix.

For the ui I will also make my first react app.
